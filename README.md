Update 8/13/2020: It's been a long time. I forgot this thing existed. I see there are a few people that have forked it. Would recommend you check out those as they are more up to date and/or support modern things like Python 3.

Mr Money Mustache blog Ebook creator

Python script pulls data from MMM's blog (http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) and outputs HTML pages to import through a tool such as Calibre to create into an EBook of the desired format.

Script Depends on lxml. Calibre or a similar tool is also necessary to use after the script.

See the following for Mr Money Mustache's endorsement and comments on this project (originally posted here http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/forum/welcome-to-the-forum/making-a-mr-money-mustache-ebook/ ):

"Awesome work!! You hereby have my full approval to share this book (and work together to improve it if you like). As long as you give it away for free!

I'll finish the real, much better book eventually. Currently distracted by other fun stuff including building the new house.

Thanks as always for sharing your cool and innovative ideas."
